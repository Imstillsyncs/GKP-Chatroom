# LowChat

A powerful chatting application which supports commands, nicknames, rooms, and is simplistic in design.

The hosted server can be found [here](https://chat.hyperjs.ml/)

# How to get OP
Note: For this to happen, you need to fork my reply into your own.

On Replit, create a secret via the sidebar called "ADMIN" and set its value to the admin password you want

Once you have the key setup and the repl restarted, you can use the `/key [password]` command to become an operator.
